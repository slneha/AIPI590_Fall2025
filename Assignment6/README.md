# Human-AI Interaction Assignment

Two explanations were created as part of the submission:

1. **Explanation 1 – Algorithm Summary and Flowchart**
2. **Explanation 2 – Code Tutorial with Markdown Commentary**

## Explanation 1: Algorithm and Flowchart Summary

**Objective:**  
To present the **LIME algorithm** in a clear, structured way suitable for developers, researchers, and technical audiences who want to understand the method conceptually before implementation.

**Content Summary:**
- Explained the purpose of LIME and its relevance to black-box models.  
- Described each step of the algorithm in detail, from selecting an instance to computing local weights and fitting a surrogate model.  
- Clarified both the mathematical and intuitive components behind local approximation.  
- Included a step-by-step flowchart illustrating the relationship between data perturbation, weighting, and local linear modeling.  
- Highlighted how outputs like feature importance and local fidelity provide human-understandable insights.

**Audience and Style:**  
Tailored for an academic and technical audience, focusing on mathematical and procedural correctness, while maintaining readability.

## Explanation 2: Code Tutorial with Markdown

**Objective:**  
To demonstrate how LIME can be implemented programmatically in Python and how each step of the algorithm can be annotated for clarity and transparency.

**Content Summary:**
- Implemented a class that mirrors the algorithm described in Explanation 1 (the steps are heavily referenced, but it is not required to read through Explanation 1 to understand this.  
- Each section of the code corresponds to one step in the algorithm, with descriptive comments to connect theory and implementation.  
- Markdown cells explain the purpose of each block and interpret results (feature importance and local fidelity).  
- Included a results section explaining how to read the bar chart and interpret the influence of features.  

**Audience and Style:**  
Tailored for students and practitioners who wish to understand LIME through both conceptual and code-based perspectives.  
The Markdown explanations were written to be beginner-friendly and emphasize interpretability over raw computation.
