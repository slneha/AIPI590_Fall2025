# AIPI Assignment 5 â€“ Explainable Deep Learning

This repository contains the Colab notebook and results for **AIPI Assignment 5**.  
The assignment investigates model explainability in computer vision by applying Grad-CAM and its variants to a recycling classification task.

---

## Problem Statement
The study focuses on explainability in a **recycling classification** setting using a pretrained **ResNet-50** model (ImageNet).  
The objective is to analyze which visual cues the model attends to when predicting object categories such as cardboard, plastic, and glass, and to compare the attention maps generated by different CAM methods.

## Methods
- **Model**: ResNet-50 (pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on a recycling dataset)  
- **Explainability Techniques**:
  - Grad-CAM
  - Layer-CAM
  - Eigen-CAM  
- **Dataset**: Recycling images accessed via Kaggle in Colab
